### **Document 1: The Problem Statement & Product Requirements**

**Title:** A VS Code-Centric Interface for Interactive Gemini CLI Sessions

**Author:** The User

**Version:** 2.0 

#### **1. Vision & Overview**

I want to use the Gemini CLI as a powerful, interactive, conversational partner and mentor. Its core functionality, especially its extensibility with MCP servers, is exactly what I need. However, the default terminal interface is a significant barrier to my productivity and comfort.

This document outlines the requirements for a solution that allows me to conduct a full, stateful, interactive session with the Gemini CLI, but with all input and output handled through simple text files within my preferred editor, VS Code.

#### **2. The Core Problem**

The standard terminal shell is a poor user interface for a rich, conversational experience.

*   **Workflow Disruption:** My entire development workflow is centered in VS Code. Constantly switching to a terminal to type multi-line prompts or read formatted responses is inefficient and breaks my concentration.
*   **Poor Text Editing:** Terminals lack the advanced editing, navigation, and formatting capabilities of a modern text editor, making it clumsy to write and revise complex prompts.
*   **Transient History:** While shells have history, it's not a readable, single document. I want a persistent, clean log of my entire conversation that I can easily review, search, and save.
*   **The "Script" Misconception:** Treating `gemini` as a one-shot command that is executed for every prompt is fundamentally wrong for my use case. It is inefficient in terms of cost (tokens), performance (startup overhead), and, most critically, it is **stateless**, making a continuous, context-aware conversation impossible.

#### **3. The Ideal Solution: Functional Requirements**

I need a system that bridges my VS Code environment with a live, running Gemini CLI session.

1.  **Persistent Session:** The solution must launch and maintain a single, long-running Gemini CLI process in the background. This process must retain the full conversational context from start to finish.

2.  **One-Time Startup:** I have no problem starting the "bridge" or the Gemini CLI process myself from the terminal at the beginning of a work session. The goal is to eliminate any further terminal interaction after this initial setup.

3.  **Two-File I/O System:** All interaction must be handled through two distinct, user-friendly files:
    
    *   **Input File (`prompt.md`):** A dedicated file for writing prompts.
        - The **entire content** of this file is treated as the prompt upon saving.
        - My workflow is to clear the file, type a new prompt, and save.
        - No special markers, syntax, or formatting will be required from me.
    
    *   **Output File (`response.md`):** A dedicated, continuous log of all AI responses.
        - All output from the Gemini session **must** be **appended** to this file.
        - This file must never be overwritten, preserving a complete history of all AI output.

4.  **Full Feature Compatibility:** The solution must be a "transparent pipe." It should not interfere with or limit any of Gemini CLI's core functionality. This specifically includes its ability to communicate with and leverage any configured MCP servers for tasks like web browsing or file system interaction.

#### **4. Success Criteria**

The solution is successful if I can start the bridge system once, and then, using only VS Code to edit `prompt.md` and read `response.md`, conduct a complete, stateful, multi-turn conversation with Gemini CLI for hours without ever needing to look at or type into a terminal window again.
