## Risk Management Framework

### High-Risk Areas Requiring Special Attention

#### Technical Risks

**1. Threading Coordination Deadlocks - Risk Level: HIGH**

- **Description**: Two-thread coordination with queue-based communication could develop deadlocks under concurrent load or error conditions
- **Impact**: Complete system freeze requiring manual restart, potential data loss
- **Early Warning Signs**:
  - Thread join operations taking longer than expected (>5 seconds)
  - Queue operations blocking indefinitely during shutdown
  - Memory usage growing steadily during operation (potential queue backup)
  - Increasing response times under normal load conditions
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Implement comprehensive timeout mechanisms for all threading operations
  - Use bounded queues (maxsize=100) to prevent unlimited memory growth
  - Add deadlock detection with automatic thread restart capability
  - Maintain simplified fallback to sequential processing architecture
- **Contingency Plan**: Switch to single-threaded sequential processing with polling-based output reading, accepting 200-500ms latency increase for guaranteed stability

**2. Cross-Platform Subprocess Variations - Risk Level: HIGH**

- **Description**: Gemini CLI subprocess behavior, including startup, shutdown, and stream handling, may vary significantly across Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Impact**: Platform-specific failures, inconsistent user experience, increased maintenance overhead, and potential reduction in platform support.
- **Early Warning Signs**:
  - Automated cross-platform tests fail intermittently on specific OS.
  - Different response times or behaviors observed across operating systems during manual testing.
  - Platform-specific encoding, path handling, or file locking issues emerge.
  - Process startup or shutdown procedures hang or create orphan processes on one platform but not others.
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Execute a comprehensive "Phase 0: Critical Validation" across all target platforms before committing to the core implementation.
  - Implement a platform-specific configuration layer (`platform_config.py`) based on Phase 0 validation results.
  - Develop a robust error-handling system with platform-aware recovery strategies.
  - Integrate automated cross-platform testing into the continuous integration pipeline to catch regressions early.
- **Contingency Plan**: If variations prove too complex to manage reliably, document platform-specific limitations and provide workarounds. As a last resort, reduce the list of officially supported platforms to the most stable ones (e.g., Linux and macOS only) for the initial release.

**3. Gemini CLI External Dependency Stability - Risk Level: MEDIUM**

- **Description**: The bridge's functionality is entirely dependent on the Gemini CLI, which in turn relies on external Google API services. These services may experience outages, rate limiting, or breaking changes.
- **Impact**: The bridge becomes non-functional during external service disruptions, leading to a poor user experience.
- **Early Warning Signs**:
  - Increased API response times or frequent timeout errors from the CLI.
  - Unexpected changes in the response format or content structure.
  - New authentication, authorization, or rate-limiting errors appear in the CLI's stderr stream.
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Implement robust retry logic with exponential backoff for recoverable errors (e.g., temporary network issues).
  - Provide clear, user-friendly error messages that distinguish between local bridge failures and external service issues.
  - Monitor the official Gemini API status page and incorporate status checks if an API is available.
- **Contingency Plan**: There is no direct contingency for a full API outage. The plan is to ensure the bridge fails gracefully, informs the user of the external issue, and automatically recovers when the service is restored.

#### Process Risks

**1. Scope Creep - Risk Level: MEDIUM**

- **Early Warning Signs**:
  - New feature requests emerge during development that are outside the 6 "Must Have" MVP features.
  - "Quick additions" are proposed that seem small but touch complex areas like threading or subprocess management.
  - Requirements for an MVP feature change mid-implementation.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Strict adherence to the "MVP Feature Prioritization Matrix" and its "Scope Protection Framework".
  - All new feature ideas are logged in a backlog for post-MVP consideration.
  - Enforce the formal "Scope Change Process" for any proposed modifications to the MVP.
- **Contingency**: If a scope change is deemed critical, a formal re-evaluation of the 12-14 week timeline will be conducted, and a "Should Have" feature will be deferred to a future release to compensate.

**2. Quality Debt Accumulation - Risk Level: MEDIUM**

- **Early Warning Signs**:
  - Unit test coverage for critical logic drops below the 95% target.
  - An increasing number of "TODO" or "FIXME" comments appear in the codebase, especially in error handling or threading logic.
  - Manual testing checklist items are skipped to save time during weekly reviews.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Integrate automated quality checks (linting, test coverage) into the pre-commit hooks and CI pipeline.
  - Dedicate the last 30 minutes of each week to a "Technical Debt Review" to identify and prioritize cleanup tasks for the following week.
- **Contingency**: If quality metrics drop below the established thresholds for two consecutive weeks, the first two days of the following week will be dedicated to a "quality sprint" to address the accumulated debt.

### Progress Tracking and Validation

#### Daily Progress Metrics

- **Tasks Completed**: Number of tasks and their estimated effort from the current phase plan.
- **Blockers Encountered**: Any issue that stopped progress for more than 30 minutes, and the time to resolution.
- **Quality Metrics**: Unit test coverage percentage, status of integration tests, and any new linting errors introduced.
- **Technical Debt Log**: Any new shortcuts taken or existing debt addressed.

#### Weekly Milestone Validation

**Progress Assessment**:

- **Scope Completion**: Percentage of the current phase's key features and tasks completed.
- **Quality Gates**: Status of all quality gates for the current phase (e.g., "Threading stress test passes 1000+ iterations").
- **Risk Indicators**: Any early warning signs observed for the high-risk areas.
- **Timeline Adherence**: Current progress assessed as on track, ahead, or behind the 12-14 week schedule.

**Adjustment Triggers**:

- **Scope Adjustment**: If development velocity is less than 70% of the plan for a full week, the MVP scope will be reviewed for potential reduction (e.g., moving a "Should Have" feature out).
- **Quality Focus**: If critical test coverage drops below 85%, the next week's plan will prioritize testing and refactoring over new features.
- **Risk Escalation**: If a high-risk indicator is observed (e.g., a threading deadlock that takes >2 days to debug), the corresponding contingency plan (e.g., switching to the sequential fallback architecture) will be formally evaluated.

### Success Criteria and Launch Readiness

#### Technical Success Criteria

- [ ] All 6 MVP Core features are implemented, tested, and meet their acceptance criteria.
- [ ] The core user journey (write prompt -> save -> view response -> continue conversation) is completable without any terminal interaction.
- [ ] System performance meets established benchmarks: sub-500ms latency from save to stdin write, and memory usage under 50MB during an 8-hour session.
- [ ] The two-thread architecture is stable, passing a 48-hour continuous operation test without deadlocks or memory leaks.
- [ ] Graceful shutdown completes within 5 seconds, leaving no orphan processes.

#### Quality Assurance Validation

- [ ] Unit test coverage exceeds 95% for threading logic and 90% for subprocess management.
- [ ] All integration tests, including the "Complete Workflow" and "Error Recovery" scenarios, pass 100% on all target platforms.
- [ ] The "Pre-Production-Release Checklist" is fully completed and validated.
- [ ] Documentation is sufficient for a developer with intermediate Python experience to understand the architecture and maintain the code.

#### User Experience Validation

- [ ] The primary workflow is intuitive; a user can complete a 5-turn conversation without referencing documentation.
- [ ] Error messages are helpful and clearly distinguish between local and external issues.
- [ ] No more than one manual restart is required per 8-hour session during the final validation phase.

## Next Phase Handoff

### For Project Readiness Audit

**Execution Plan Completeness**: This plan provides a day-by-day, week-by-week breakdown of tasks, aligned with the strategic blueprint and technical specifications. It includes clear quality gates, risk mitigation strategies, and success criteria.
**Implementation Risks**: The key risks to monitor are **threading deadlocks** and **cross-platform inconsistencies**. The plan mitigates these by front-loading validation in Phase 0 and maintaining a well-defined sequential fallback architecture as a contingency.
**Timeline Realism**: The 12-14 week timeline is realistic for a single developer, accounting for the complexity of concurrent programming and the use of agentic coding assistance. The phased approach allows for early validation and course correction.

### Post-Planning Implementation Notes

**First Week Priorities (Phase 0)**:
1.  Set up development and testing environments on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
2.  Develop the "Subprocess Communication Proof-of-Concept" to validate Gemini CLI interaction.
3.  Implement a minimal two-thread model to begin stress testing the core coordination logic immediately.

**Early Validation Points**:
-   **End of Week 2**: A "Go/No-Go" decision on the two-thread architecture based on the stability of the PoC.
-   **End of Week 6 (Phase 1)**: A complete, single-platform conversation cycle is functional. This is the first point at which the core user journey can be tested end-to-end.

**Course Correction Triggers**:
-   If threading deadlocks persist after one week of debugging during Phase 1, immediately pivot to the single-threaded, polling-based "Sequential Fallback Architecture".
-   If the Gemini CLI proves unreliable for programmatic interaction during Phase 0, halt development and evaluate alternative interaction models before proceeding.
