## MVP Success Criteria

### Core User Journey Validation

**Primary User Workflow**: Write prompt in VS Code → Save prompt.md → View response in response.md → Continue conversation

1. **Prompt Creation**: User writes prompt in VS Code → Prompt saved to prompt.md → File change detected within 200ms
2. **Prompt Processing**: Prompt content read → Sent to Gemini CLI stdin → Process acknowledged within 1 second
3. **Response Capture**: Gemini response received → Appended to response.md → User can view in VS Code within 5 seconds
4. **Conversation Continuity**: Context maintained → Next prompt builds on previous → Multi-turn conversation successful

**Success Thresholds**:
- **Completion Rate**: 95% of prompts result in successful responses
- **Time to Value**: Users see responses within 10 seconds of saving prompt
- **Error Rate**: Less than 5% of operations encounter recoverable errors

### Technical Performance Criteria

- **Response Time**: Prompt processing completes within 500ms
- **Uptime**: Bridge operates continuously for 8+ hours without intervention
- **Error Handling**: Graceful recovery from subprocess failures and file system errors
- **Data Integrity**: Zero data loss during normal operation and shutdown

### User Satisfaction Metrics

- **Usability**: Users can complete 5+ turn conversations without referencing documentation
- **Reliability**: No more than 1 manual restart required per 8-hour session
- **Workflow Integration**: Users report improved productivity compared to terminal-based interaction

## Scope Protection Framework

### Feature Addition Criteria

Before adding any new feature to MVP scope, it must:

1. **Pass the Critical Test**: Is core file-to-CLI communication broken without this?
2. **Pass the Complexity Test**: Can this be implemented in 7 days or less?
3. **Pass the Journey Test**: Does this enable or complete the essential user workflow?
4. **Pass the Resource Test**: Can this be added without extending 8-week MVP timeline?

### Scope Change Process

1. **Impact Assessment**: Analyze effect on 6-8 week timeline and thread coordination complexity
2. **Trade-off Analysis**: Which existing "Should Have" feature moves to "Could Have"?
3. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Confirm change aligns with file-based interaction philosophy
4. **Documentation Update**: Update prioritization matrix and technical specifications

### Red Flag Indicators

Stop and reassess if you observe:

- MVP scope growing beyond 8 Must Have features
- Any single feature requiring more than 10 days development
- Total MVP timeline exceeding 8 weeks
- Core user journey requiring more than 6 features to function
- Thread coordination complexity requiring more than 2 threads

## Next Phase Handoff

### For Development Execution Planning

**Priority Sequence**: Configuration Management → Error Logging → Subprocess Management → File Watcher → Prompt Processing → Response Logging → Two-Thread Coordination → Graceful Shutdown

**Risk Mitigation**: Two-Thread Coordination requires early prototyping to validate architecture assumptions. Cross-Platform Compatibility should be validated on target platforms before Phase 4.

**User Feedback Points**: After Phase 2 (basic subprocess integration), After Phase 3 (complete user workflow), Before production release (8-hour continuous operation test)

### Success Validation Plan

**Milestone Checkpoints**: 
- Week 2: Bridge launches and logs errors clearly
- Week 4: Manual prompt reaches Gemini CLI successfully  
- Week 6: Complete conversation cycle works in VS Code
- Week 8: 8-hour continuous operation without issues

**Pivot Triggers**: 
- Thread coordination deadlocks persist after 1 week debugging → Move to sequential processing architecture
- Cross-platform issues block progress → Focus on single platform for MVP
- Gemini CLI integration proves unreliable → Evaluate alternative CLI tools or approaches

**Launch Readiness**: 
- Complete 5-turn conversation without terminal interaction
- 8-hour continuous operation test passed
- Error recovery tested and documented
- User documentation complete with troubleshooting guide

FINAL REMARKS:
## Key Strategic Insights

**Scope Focus**: I've identified 6 critical features for the MVP core, cutting through the complexity to focus on the essential user journey: write prompt → save file → view response → continue conversation. This represents roughly 6-8 weeks of the total 12-14 week timeline.

**Risk Mitigation**: The two-thread coordination feature is flagged as the highest complexity risk. I recommend early prototyping of this component since it's foundational to preventing deadlocks, which was a major concern in your QA audit response.

**Timeline Alignment**: The phased approach maps directly to your revised strategic blueprint, with Phase 0 validation work feeding into these prioritization decisions. The 8-week MVP timeline fits within your overall 12-14 week project scope.

## Critical Architecture Validation

Based on the technical foundation specification, I've made several important prioritization decisions:

1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility** moved to "Should Have" - while important, you can validate core functionality on a single platform first
2. **Configuration Management** kept simple in MVP - hardcoded defaults are sufficient for initial validation
3. **Performance Optimization** deferred until after core functionality is stable

## Potential Concerns

I notice the strategic blueprint mentions "Phase 0 Critical Validation" but some assumptions in the MVP prioritization may need validation:

- The file watcher debouncing strategy (200ms) assumes this prevents race conditions
- The two-thread model complexity may still require the sequential fallback architecture mentioned in your contingency planning

The prioritization matrix provides clear criteria for scope protection and includes specific triggers for switching to your alternative implementation paths if complexity proves unmanageable.
