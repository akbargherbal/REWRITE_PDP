### **Part 1: Project Vision & Problem Statement**

#### **1.1. High-Level Vision**

To enable a powerful, interactive, and stateful conversational experience with the Gemini CLI by abstracting away the command-line interface and allowing all user interaction to occur within the comfort and efficiency of the VS Code editor.

#### **1.2. The Core Problem**

The standard terminal shell is a significant barrier to a fluid and productive conversational workflow with Gemini CLI. The key pain points are:

- **Workflow Disruption:** Development is centered in VS Code. Constant context-switching to a terminal to read/write is inefficient and breaks concentration.
- **Poor Text Editing:** Terminals lack the advanced editing capabilities of a modern text editor, making the composition and revision of complex prompts difficult and clumsy.
- **Transient History:** Standard shell history is not a readable, coherent document. A persistent, searchable log of the entire conversation is required.
- **Stateless Execution Risk:** A naive approach of treating `gemini` as a simple script to be run per-prompt is fundamentally flawed. It is inefficient (tokens, cost, performance) and, most critically, **stateless**, making a continuous, context-aware conversation impossible.

#### **1.3. Target User Persona**

This solution is designed for a pragmatic, Python-centric developer with a strong preference for automation and efficiency.

- **Environment:** Lives in VS Code; finds the terminal to be a high-friction environment.
- **Workflow:** Prefers file-based operations and keyboard shortcuts over command-line interaction.
- **Mindset:** Values solutions that reduce cognitive load and increase development velocity. Wants to "set and forget" background processes and focus on the task at hand.
- **Goal:** To leverage the full power of Gemini CLI (including advanced features like MCP servers) without being forced into an uncomfortable or inefficient user interface.

### **Part 2: Functional Requirements & Scope**

#### **2.1. Functional Requirements**

1.  **Persistent Session:** The solution **must** launch and maintain a single, long-running Gemini CLI process in the background, ensuring conversational context is retained throughout the session.

2.  **One-Time Startup:** A one-time, manual startup of the bridge system from the terminal is acceptable. All subsequent interaction must be terminal-free.

3.  **Two-File I/O System:** All interaction will be handled through two distinct, user-friendly files:

    - **Input File (`prompt.md`):** A dedicated file for writing prompts.
      - The **entire content** of this file is treated as the prompt upon saving.
      - The user's workflow is to clear the file, type a new prompt, and save.
      - No special markers, syntax, or formatting will be required from the user.
    - **Output File (`response.md`):** A dedicated, continuous log of all AI responses.
      - All output from the Gemini session **must** be **appended** to this file.
      - This file must never be overwritten, preserving a complete history of all AI output.

4.  **Full Feature Compatibility:** The bridge must act as a transparent data pipe, not interfering with or limiting any of Gemini CLI's core functionality, specifically including its ability to leverage configured MCP servers.

#### **2.2. Success Criteria**

The project is successful if the user can launch the bridge script once, and then, using only VS Code to edit `prompt.md` and read `response.md`, conduct a complete, stateful, multi-turn conversation with Gemini CLI for an entire session without ever touching the terminal again.

### **Part 3: Technical Architecture & Solution Design**

#### **3.1. Guiding Principles**

The architecture is built on the user's two-file model, prioritizing simplicity and workflow elegance. The Gemini CLI is treated as a **persistent background process**, not a stateless script. A "Process Bridge" script will manage all I/O between the file system and the live Standard Input/Output streams of the Gemini process.

#### **3.2. System Components & Data Flow**

The system consists of three core components connected by the bridge script:

```
+---------------------------+       +-------------------------+       +------------------------+
|                           |       |                         |       |                        |
|   VS Code (User's View)   | <---- | Python Bridge Script    | ----> | Gemini CLI Process     |
|                           |       |   (bridge.py)           |       | (Running in Background)|
+---------------------------+       +-------------------------+       +------------------------+
| - Writes to `prompt.md`   |       | - Watches `prompt.md`   |       | - Reads from stdin     |
| - Reads from `response.md`|       | - Writes to `response.md`|      | - Writes to stdout     |
+---------------------------+       +-------------------------+       +------------------------+
           ^                                |           |                       |
           |                                |           |                       |
           |                                |           +-----------------------+---> [MCP Server (Optional)]
           +--------------------------------+
             (File System is the interface)
```

#### **3.3. Detailed Step-by-Step Workflow**

1.  **System Startup:** The user runs `python bridge.py`. The script launches the `gemini` command as a managed child process, capturing its `stdin` and `stdout`. A background thread is started to listen to `stdout`, and a file watcher is set to monitor `prompt.md`.

2.  **User Writes Prompt:** In VS Code, the user opens `prompt.md`, clears any existing text, types a new prompt (e.g., `"How does CSS Flexbox work?"`), and **saves** the file.

3.  **Bridge Detects Change:** The file watcher instantly detects the modification event on `prompt.md`.

4.  **Bridge Sends to Gemini:** The bridge script opens `prompt.md`, reads its **entire content**, and writes that content directly to the `stdin` stream of the running Gemini process, followed by a newline character to ensure execution.

5.  **Gemini Processes:** The Gemini process receives the text via its standard input. It processes the prompt, using its internal memory to maintain the conversational context, and formulates a response.

6.  **Gemini Responds:** Gemini writes its full response to its standard output.

7.  **Bridge Receives & Writes:** The dedicated background listener thread in the bridge script, which has been waiting patiently, captures this output. It immediately opens `response.md` in **append mode** and writes the complete response to the end of the file. The cycle is complete.

#### **3.4. MCP Server Integration**

This architecture is fully compatible with MCP servers. The bridge script is agnostic to the content of the conversation; it is merely a data pipe. If a prompt requires web browsing (e.g., `"Go to cnn.com and summarize the top headline"`), the Gemini CLI process will independently communicate with its configured MCP server over the local network. The bridge will transparently pass the initial prompt and later append the final, synthesized response to `response.md` without any special handling.

### **Part 4: Implementation Plan**

#### **4.1. Required File Structure**

The user's project directory will contain the following files:

```
/your-gemini-project/
|-- prompt.md           # The file you write your prompts in.
|-- response.md         # The file where Gemini's answers appear.
|-- bridge.py           # The Python script that makes everything work.
```

#### **4.2. Next Steps**

The next step is to provide the complete, production-ready Python code for `bridge.py` that implements the technical design specified in this document.
